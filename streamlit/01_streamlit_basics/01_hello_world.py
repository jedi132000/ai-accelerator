Example 1: Hello World - Understanding Script Execution

Key Teaching Points:
- Streamlit runs your script from top to bottom on every interaction
- Each widget interaction triggers a complete rerun
- This is fundamentally different from traditional web frameworks

    **Key Concepts Demonstrated:**
    - Script reruns on every interaction
    - Widgets trigger reruns when their values change
    - Session state preserves data across reruns
    - Without session_state, variables would reset every time
