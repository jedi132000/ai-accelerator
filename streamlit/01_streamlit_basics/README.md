# Streamlit Basics - Teaching Materials

This folder contains progressive examples to teach Streamlit fundamentals to experienced tech professionals.

## Teaching Sequence

1. **01_hello_world.py** - Basic app structure and script execution model
2. **02_session_state.py** - Understanding persistence across reruns
3. **03_chat_interface.py** - Building chat-style interfaces
4. **04_sidebar_widgets.py** - User controls and configuration
5. **05_complete_example.py** - Putting it all together

## Key Concepts to Emphasize

- **Script Execution Model**: Top-to-bottom execution on every interaction
- **Session State**: The persistence layer that survives reruns
- **Widget State**: How user inputs trigger reruns
- **Chat Components**: Modern interface patterns for AI applications

## Running the Examples

```bash
pip install streamlit
streamlit run 01_hello_world.py
```

Each example builds upon the previous one, introducing new concepts incrementally.
